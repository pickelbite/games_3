    "body": "New features:\r\n- Input rewrite. Finally after a long time coming, SeerLite comes in clutch and the input rewrite is here. This should fix most issues related to input like dead keys, accents -  especially the Linux issues AND allows Android input (all though due to some limitations out of our control we could not disable autocorrect at this time, so it might cause some funny behavior - report anything you find). There are still some things to do to make it perfect, but this is a great start. Massive shoutout to SeerLite again. \r\n- Top % display. You can now check on the leaderboard how you compare to the rest of the users on the site.\r\n- Show all PBs. Below the personal bests tables, you will now find buttons to show all your personal bests including different configs.\r\n\r\nLanguages:\r\n- Typo fixes.\r\n- Added diacritics back to Arabic 10k (they can be removed with lazy mode). Thanks ZER0-X.\r\n\r\nQuotes:\r\n- Fixed typos and grammatical errors.\r\n- Added more Arabic and Turkish quotes. Thanks HasanTheSyrian.\r\n- Fixed Indonesian quotes not loading.\r\n\r\nLayouts:\r\n- Updated APT and Boo. Thanks Apsu.\r\n- Added Arabic. Thanks Mustafa-Asaad-iq.\r\n- Added Arabic Mac. Thanks AliQ80.\r\n\r\nFonts:\r\n- Added JetBrains Mono. THanks luehmann.\r\n\r\nThemes:\r\n- Added Soaring Skies. Thanks Hakata-jpn.\r\n- Added Sewing Tin. Thanks minicap-cat.\r\n- Added Chaos Theory. Thanks mTopy.\r\n\r\nSounds:\r\n- All sounds now have appropriate names instead of just numbers.\r\n- Added osu and hitmaker sounds.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n- Fixed a bug that would cause the website to freeze when trying to practise missed and slow words, but no words were found.\r\n- Fixed broken new line characters in custom mode.\r\n- Fixed leaderboards extending past the bottom edge of the screen.\r\n- Initialising sounds only when needed. This should fix a weird issue where Bluetooth headphones would not go to sleep automatically when the website was in focus.\r\n- Fixed name change not working correctly when user was signed in with Google.\r\n- Fixed quote rating icon not updating after submitting a rating.\r\n- Fixed total ratings and average score numbers not updating correctly after submitting a quote rating.\r\n- Fixed plus one and plus two funboxes not working with quotes.\r\n\r\nOther changes and improvements:\r\n- Updated Apple touch icons to feature the new logo.\r\n- Fixed up some animations taking too long.\r\n- Updated Always Show CPM to work across the whole website including charts.\r\n- Personal Bests will no longer be saved when the test was stopped early with the Bail Out feature.\r\n- Updated the British English word pairs. Thanks Banzobotic.\r\n- Added more accents to lazy mode.\r\n- Various grammatical and structural changes to contributing and readme files. Thanks UnrealApex, Rishav-mngo.\r\n- Added more username filters.\r\n- Added more logs to the backend code.\r\n- Cleaned up lint warnings. Removed old code.",

(this has been live for quite some time now, but I forgot to add it to the previous change log) With this option, you will be able to randomize phrases instead of just words in custom mode. Thanks Pranav\r\n- Leaderboards are back baby. And this time, they are infinite - everyone gets a spot on them! Only 50 ranks are loaded at the start, so keep scrolling to load more! To handle the large scale of them, they will now only refresh once per 5 minutes, but in my opinion its a fair trade. If it goes well with the new leaderboards, language leaderboards could see the light of day (finally).\r\n- Added British English mode. When enabled, the website will use British word spellings (the list might be incomplete, so report any words that are not converted correctly)\r\n- Added Lazy Mode. When enabled, any accented letters will be replaced with their normal equivalents. This mode has its own personal bests, just like, for example, difficulty or punctuation.\r\n\r\nQuotes:\r\n- Added more Thai quotes. Thanks ronnapatp.\r\n- Added more Arabic quotes. Thanks Mustafa-Asaad-iq.\r\n- Various typo fixes.\r\n- Added more Code Javascript quotes. Thanks yourealt.\r\n- Made sure all quotes end with a full stop, or punctuation. Thanks iamlambda.\r\n\r\nLanguages:\r\n- Fixed capitalisation of some Spanish words. Thanks iuuang.\r\n- Removed extra spaces from words in Code CSharp. Thanks sphhax.\r\n- Added Italian 60k and 280k. Thanks marcoferrari2409.\r\n\r\nThemes:\r\n- Added Terror Below.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n- Fixed funbox challenges not loading.\r\n- Fixed hide extra letters showing an error line when blind mode is enabled.\r\n- Fixed color input borders on Firefox. Thanks refact0r.\r\n- Fixed excessive number of config saves causing some users to hit the rate limit.\r\n- Fixed not all underscores being replaced with spaces in the footer's theme name display.\r\n\r\nOther changes and improvements:\r\n- Updated the look and layout of account page pb tables.\r\n- Disabled challenge links for now. They are proving to be quite annoying to get right, and also awarding roles when not actually completing the challenge.\r\n- Added 'last 3 months' date filter to the account page.\r\n\r\nBackend changes:\r\n- Results now use serverside date when saving.\r\n- Added maintenance mode that can be triggered on and off to stop the server from processing requests.\r\n- Added more logs.",

This are starting to speed up again!\r\n\r\nNew features:\r\n- Added Weakspot funbox. With this funbox, you will be able to train letters that you type slow or mistype by altering the word generation based on your previous tests. This is just the initial version and will be updated with time, as we are not sure if the words are changed too much or not enough. Thanks shishberg.\r\n- Added burst heatmap to the result screen. You can find the button next to the 'Copy words list' button. This will highlight words in different colors based on their burst speed (which, to remind you, is measured in raw wpm from the first keypress to last keypress - so excluding time between words).\r\n- Added Today Tracker. This will display how much time you've spent typing, on the result screen, below the test time. If you have not downloaded your user results yet, it will show the current session typing time. However, if you have visited the account screen at least once, it will sum all the time typing from the current day.\r\n- Language-specific punctuation. Punctuation mode will now take into consideration the currently selected language and change accordingly. Currently the affected languages so far are French, Spanish, Russian, Spanish, Catalan, Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Greek, Ukrainian and Code. If your language is missing, or the custom punctuation is incorrect, let me know.\r\n\r\nQuotes:\r\n- Fixed typos.\r\n- Added loads of German quotes. Thanks Meimersdorfer.\r\n- Added Dutch quotes. Thanks polygonalenippel.\r\n\r\nThemes:\r\n- Added VSCode. Thanks Odyssey346.\r\n\r\nLayouts:\r\n- Added Semimak.\r\n- Added Boo. Thanks Apsu.\r\n\r\nLanguages:\r\n- Added English 5k.\r\n- Updated Javascript.

Thanks lukew3.\r\n- Fixed repeated pace caret being stuck.\r\n- Fixed jumpy animation when 'always show words history' is enabled.\r\n- Fixed a bug where you could type while the leaderboards were open.\r\n- Fixed a bug where min burst had no default config value.\r\n- Fixed a bug where key tips could not be toggled from the command line.\r\n\r\nOther changes and improvements:\r\n- Presets will now remember active tags.\r\n- Reworked the command line. Each option now has an icon, to visually represent a setting. There are also checkmark icons to represent which setting is active. No more toggle settings where you don't know if the setting is active or not!\r\n- Updated the look of custom text popup on very small displays. Thanks DrPoppyseed.\r\n- Pace caret will no longer jump forward when stop on word is enabled.\r\n- Brought back the button to clear tag pb.\r\n- Purged as many bad words from lists and quotes as I could find.\r\n- Updating email does not require the current email anymore. However, it does require that you type the new email twice.\r\n- Clearing personal bests now requires your password.\r\n- Added username to the built-in screenshot.",

    "body": "New features:\r\n- Added min burst. This setting works similarly to min wpm and min accuracy where the test will fail if you fail to meet the criteria. Burst is how fast you type a single word from the first keystroke to the last. This means that burst is measured in raw wpm and does not include the pause between words. You can pick between fixed mode and flex mode. With flex mode, longer words automatically lower the threshold a bit.\r\n\r\nLanguages:\r\n- Added Ukrainian with 1k, 10k and 50k options.\r\n- Updated Urdu and added Urdu 1k. Thanks BalkoBalkho.\r\n- Updated Czech 10k. Thanks CrumblyLiquid.\r\n- Added Pinyin. Thanks KobeCofini.\r\n\r\nQuotes:\r\n- Added 82 French quotes. Thanks precondition.\r\n\r\nThemes:\r\n- Added Ez Mode. Thanks kraiztmatte.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n- Fixed a bug where words added in random custom mode would not be randomized.\r\n- Fixed a bug that would cause Firefox to not load the first page.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the caret would sometimes move up when moving to the next word.\r\n- Fixed a bug where the opposite shift would get stuck in a state of 'both shifts pressed' and would result in the user not being able to type on one half of the keyboard.\r\n- Fixed failed tests having unwanted afk time.\r\n\r\nOther changes and improvements:\r\n- Funboxes plus one and plus two will contribute towards your personal best (since it doesn't affect word generation or speed calculation and some users have those funboxes are good for accessibility).\r\n- Removed some leftover console logs.\r\n- When hide extra letters is enabled, an error underline will be shown under the word if the input length is greater than the word length.\r\n- Updated the tags section design on the settings page to match the design of the presets section.\r\n- Removed the underscore from the language name when displayed on the result screen.\r\n- Added fail reason to the result screen.\r\n- Updated the design of the min wpm, min acc, and pace caret settings sections.\r\n- You can now view the burst speed of any word on the result screen by hovering over that word in the result history.",

Remember to share any thoughts you might have too.\r\n\r\nLanguages:\r\n- Added Urdu. Thanks BalkoBalkho.\r\n- Updated Filipino words. Thanks Killer8Hyper.\r\n- Fixed Lithuanian typos.

This amount could be updated if you guys feel like it's not enough.\r\n- Moved the layoutfluid command in the command line.\r\n- Words will no longer jump up slightly after finishing a test.\r\n- Restarting the test when applying a settings preset.\r\n- Added Bigram Salad and I Can See The Future to the list of supported 'quick setup' challenges.\r\n- Changing highlight mode will now cause the current word to update to reflect the change.\r\n- Added a timer to the replay.

    "body": "The Rewrite Update. It might not have many new awesome features, but I completely rewrote all of the scripts, dividing them nicely into modules. This creates a solid foundation to continue work on Tribe. If you ever thought about contributing to the project, but were scared away by the file structure - it should be easier to understand the project layout now. Now to merge this over to the Tribe branch, and its smooth sailing from now on.\r\n\r\nNew features:\r\n- Word filter. With this new feature, you are able to filter any language list of your choosing. You can include or exclude words, bigrams or characters, and further filter the words by length. You can find it in the custom text popup window. Thanks Smithster.\r\n\r\nQuotes:\r\n- Added loads of quotes suggested by the Discord server members.\r\n- Added Portuguese quotes. Thanks pserey.\r\n- Added more Polish quotes. Thanks 0x8b.\r\n- Fixed Russian quotes using incorrect space character.\r\n- Moved a comma in a German quote.\r\n\r\nLanguages:\r\n- Added Spanish 10k. Thanks iuuang.\r\n- Removed some words from Danish.\r\n- Added Polish 200k. Thanks 0x8b.\r\n- Updated the Filipino 1k list. Thanks Killer8Hyper.\r\n\r\nThemes:\r\n- Added Grand Prix theme. Thanks zekth.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n- Fixed custom fonts not applying and sometimes breaking config loading and saving. Thanks leduyquang753. \r\n- Fixed line pace caret being too low.\r\n- Fixed change qutoe length > all command not working. Thanks 0x8b.\r\n- Fixed a bug where new line characters after 100th word would not display/work correctly.\r\n\r\nOther changes and improvements:\r\n- Smoothed out the transition between test config and sign out button when changing pages.\r\n- Changed the icon of the quote search to a search icon instead of a tools icon.\r\n- Limited the quote source width so that it doesn't take up loads of space on the result screen.\r\n- Added the ability to copy words to clipboard from the command line. Thanks 0x8b.\r\n- Improved custom test duration input parsing. You can now input strings like '1h', '1m + 10s' and so on, and it will automatically be converted to seconds and applied. Thanks 0x8b.\r\n- Rewrote the whole website, moving away from huge files in favour of small, focused modules."
